          <h1>People will be affected by these changes in three main ways: fire, water, and carbon</h1>
          <p>Climate change influences us through its imapct on the services that ecosystems and biodiversity provide. Ecosystem services are the benefits that humans derive from the earth's ecosystems &#8212; including fisheries, drinking water, fertile soils for growing crops, climate regulation, inspiration, and aesthetic and cultural values. Some of these benefits, like food, are more easily quantified than others, such as climate regulation, or cultural values. Yet even the more easily quantified ecosystem services are often taken for granted.</p>
          <p>Forests provide numerous benfits to humanity: they contribute to jobs, economic growth, health, and human well-being. Perturbations of forests from climate change quality, reduced forest productivity, including both commercially-harvestable wood, and carbon storage capacity,as well as the reduction of recreational opportunities and animal species that depend upon forests, loss of iconic species and landscapes, and distorted rhythms of nature.</p>
          <p><strong>Fire &#8212;</strong> Fires are a natural part of the ecology of all forest systems, but they have been suppressed in the western U.S. forests for nearly a century, leading to increased fuel loads. This, combined with warming and drying(earlier spring and snowmelt), have been linked to increases in the size and severity of fires in the western U.S.<super>4-5</super>, a trend that is expected to continue with further warming and drying<super>6</super>. This includes the threat of so-called "mega-fires", characterized by "catastrophic damages in terms of human casualties and economic losses... with deep, long-lasting social, economic, and environmental consequences."<super>7</super></p>
          <p><strong>Water &#8212;</strong> When forest cover is lost, either through drought-induced die-off or fire, the hydrology of the landscape is changed, reducing its capacity to yield drinking water. Throughout the west, human populations depend on snow-pack in forested areas for drinking water - they literally act as "water towers" for near-by lower-elevation, semi-arid and arid areas where millions live. Forested areas yield more drinkable water than other vegetation types (shrublands, grasslands).</p>
          <p<strong>Carbon &#8212;</strong> An important ecosystem service provided by forests is that forests absorb and store carbon dioxide. They play a role in global climate regulation, potentially helping to slow the pace of climate change.</p>
